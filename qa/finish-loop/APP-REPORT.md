## 5. Decisions applied
- Review 2: no estimated scores, no Tier 1 claim without TIER1.json PASS.
- C-09 honesty rules remain in force.
- DECISIONS IDs from fleet audit apply when the real close-out is written.

## 6. Remaining items (known gaps from PROGRESS)
- TIER1.json smoke currently FAIL (Review 2)
- finish-matrix smoke just wired (C-21) — full 15×2 not yet green
- Lighthouse JSON per primary route missing (C-22)
- Self-host fonts still open where applicable (C-16)
- Physical VO/TB ⛔ BLOCKED-EXTERNAL

Human / hardware still required where marked BLOCKED-EXTERNAL.

## 7. Regressions caught
None in this stub commit. Matrix failures (if any) are expected and drive the queue.

PWA / store / TestFlight: **not certified** in Review 2. FLEET-AUDIT §J risks unchanged until close-out.
